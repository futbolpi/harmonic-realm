# Cosmic Terms & Conditions

**Last updated:** {new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' })}

Welcome to HarmonicRealm! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your cosmic journey through our mystical exploration realm and related Lattice services.

<InfoAlert>
  By accessing and exploring HarmonicRealm, you accept and agree to be bound by
  these cosmic terms. If you do not agree, please do not enter the Lattice.
</InfoAlert>

## Acceptance of Cosmic Terms

By creating a Pioneer account, accessing, or exploring HarmonicRealm, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

### Pioneer Eligibility

- You must be at least 13 years old to explore HarmonicRealm
- You must have a valid Pi Network account for Lattice access
- You must comply with all applicable laws in your dimensional jurisdiction
- You represent that all cosmic information provided is accurate and complete

## Harmonic Resonance Rules and Fair Exploration

<FeatureCard
  icon={Shield}
  title="Fair Resonance Policy"
  description="We maintain a fair and mystical exploration environment for all Pioneers through strict anti-cheat measures and cosmic community guidelines."
  color="text-primary"
/>

### Lattice Verification

**Physical Presence Required**: Pioneers must be physically present at Echo Guardian Node locations. Any attempt to circumvent harmonic verification is strictly prohibited and disrupts the cosmic balance.

**Prohibited Cosmic Activities:**

- Using GPS spoofing or location manipulation tools that disrupt the Lattice
- Employing automated bots or scripts that interfere with Echo Guardians
- Sharing Pioneer accounts or allowing others to resonate on your behalf
- Using modified or unofficial app versions that corrupt harmonic frequencies

<WarningAlert>
  Violation of Lattice verification rules will result in immediate Pioneer
  account suspension and forfeiture of earned Shares, as the cosmic balance must
  be maintained.
</WarningAlert>

### Pioneer Integrity

<FeatureCard

  title="One Pioneer Policy"
  description="Each person is allowed only one HarmonicRealm Pioneer account to ensure fair cosmic competition and harmonic reward distribution."
  color="text-neon-green"
/>

**Pioneer Account Rules:**

- One account per person/Pi Network Pioneer
- Pioneer accounts are non-transferable across dimensions
- Account sharing disrupts harmonic resonance and is prohibited
- Multiple accounts by the same person will be terminated to preserve cosmic balance

### Respectful Cosmic Behavior

**Community Standards**: All Pioneers must maintain respectful behavior toward other Pioneers, property guardians, and local communities while exploring the Lattice.

**Expected Cosmic Conduct:**

- Respect private property and local laws while seeking Echo Guardians
- Be considerate of other Pioneers and community members during exploration
- Report inappropriate behavior or technical issues affecting the Lattice
- Follow local regulations when visiting Echo Guardian locations

## Pi Network Lattice Integration

<FeatureCard

  title="Pi Cosmic Ecosystem Integration"

  color="text-neon-purple"
/>

### Pi Network Cosmic Dependency

- HarmonicRealm is built on the Pi Network cosmic ecosystem
- All Pi transactions are subject to Pi Network's terms and cosmic conditions
- We are not responsible for Pi Network service availability or cosmic transaction processing
- Pi Network authentication is required for all Lattice functions

### Harmonic Reward System

**Share-to-Pi Conversion**: Earned Miner Shares are converted to Pi based on our cosmic reward algorithm and Lattice revenue.

**Cosmic Reward Distribution:**

- Rewards are calculated based on harmonic resonance session performance
- Conversion rates may vary based on cosmic Lattice metrics
- Rewards are subject to Pi Network cosmic transaction processing
- We reserve the right to adjust reward algorithms for cosmic balance

<InfoAlert>
  Reward rates and cosmic conversion formulas may be updated to maintain Lattice
  balance and sustainability. Pioneers will be notified of significant cosmic
  changes.
</InfoAlert>

## Pioneer Responsibilities

### Cosmic Account Security

<FeatureCard
  icon={Lock}
  title="Harmonic Security Obligations"
  description="Pioneers are responsible for maintaining the security of their accounts and protecting their Pi Network cosmic credentials."
  color="text-neon-orange"
/>

**Your Cosmic Responsibilities:**

- Maintain the security of your Pi Network cosmic account
- Use strong, unique passwords for Lattice access
- Report suspicious cosmic activity immediately
- Keep your app updated to the latest harmonic version
- Protect your device from unauthorized Lattice access

### Dimensional Legal Compliance

**Jurisdictional Compliance**: Pioneers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their dimensional jurisdiction.

**Cosmic Legal Obligations:**

- Follow all local, state, and federal laws while exploring
- Respect intellectual property rights and cosmic copyrights
- Comply with tax obligations for earned cosmic rewards
- Adhere to location-specific regulations during Echo Guardian encounters

### Responsible Cosmic Exploration

**Safe Lattice Navigation**: Pioneers are responsible for their safety while exploring and resonating with Echo Guardians.

**Cosmic Safety Guidelines:**

- Be aware of your surroundings at all times during exploration
- Respect private property and no-trespassing signs while seeking Nodes
- Follow traffic laws and safety regulations during cosmic journeys
- Don't resonate with Echo Guardians in dangerous or restricted areas
- Use common sense and prioritize personal safety over Lore Fragment collection

<WarningAlert>
  HarmonicRealm is not responsible for any injuries, accidents, or incidents
  that occur while exploring the cosmic Lattice. Pioneers participate at their
  own dimensional risk.
</WarningAlert>

## Lattice Service Availability and Cosmic Modifications

### Cosmic Service Uptime

We strive to maintain high Lattice availability but cannot guarantee uninterrupted cosmic access.

**Lattice Service Considerations:**

- Scheduled cosmic maintenance may temporarily affect Lattice availability
- Emergency updates may require brief Lattice service interruptions
- Third-party dependencies (Pi Network) may impact cosmic functionality
- We aim for 99% uptime but cannot guarantee continuous Lattice service

### Right to Cosmic Modification

<FeatureCard
  icon={Sparkles}
  title="Lattice Evolution"
  description="We reserve the right to modify, update, or enhance cosmic features to improve the exploration experience and maintain Lattice service quality."
  color="text-primary"
/>

**Cosmic Modification Rights:**

- Update harmonic mechanics and cosmic reward systems
- Add, modify, or remove Echo Guardian features
- Adjust terms and policies with cosmic notice
- Suspend or terminate Pioneer accounts for Lattice violations

**Pioneer Notification:**

- Significant cosmic changes will be communicated through the Lattice
- Policy updates will be posted with updated cosmic dates
- Pioneers will have reasonable notice of major Lattice changes

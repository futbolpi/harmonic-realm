# Your Cosmic Privacy Matters

**Last updated:** {new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', { year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' })}

At HarmonicRealm, we understand that your journey through the cosmic Lattice requires trust. This Privacy Policy explains how we protect your data while you resonate with Echo Guardians and collect Lore Fragments.

<InfoAlert>
  We are committed to transparency and will never sell your personal data to
  third parties. Your privacy is as sacred as the cosmic Lattice itself.
</InfoAlert>

## Information We Collect

### Pi Lattice Authentication

<FeatureCard
  icon={UserCheck}
  title="Pioneer Identity Data"
  description="We collect your Pi Network credentials when you authenticate through the cosmic Lattice. This information enables your harmonic resonance with Echo Guardians."
  color="text-primary"
/>

**What we collect:**

- Pi Network User ID (required for Lattice authentication)
- Pi Network username (for Pioneer identification)
- Authentication tokens (temporary, for session harmonization)

**Why we collect it:**

- Verify your Pioneer status within the Pi Network ecosystem
- Enable secure Pi transactions and Share distribution
- Provide personalized cosmic exploration experience

### Harmonic Location Data

<FeatureCard
  icon={Globe}
  title="Resonance Coordinates"
  description="We collect your device's location only when you're actively resonating with the Lattice to verify your proximity to Echo Guardian Nodes."
  color="text-neon-green"
/>

**What we collect:**

- Real-time GPS coordinates (only during active resonance sessions)
- Proximity data to Echo Guardian Nodes
- Movement patterns for harmonic verification

**What we DON'T collect:**

- Location history when not exploring the Lattice
- Detailed movement tracking outside of resonance sessions
- Personal location data unrelated to cosmic exploration

<WarningAlert>
  Location data is processed through harmonic algorithms in real-time and is not
  permanently stored. We only retain the minimum necessary information to verify
  legitimate Echo Guardian encounters.
</WarningAlert>

### Cosmic Progress Data

<FeatureCard
  icon={Database}
  title="Pioneer Journey Information"
  description="We store your resonance sessions, earned Shares, collected Lore Fragments, and cosmic progress to provide a personalized exploration experience."
  color="text-neon-purple"
/>

**What we collect:**

- Resonance session data (duration, location, Shares earned)
- Lore Fragment collection and cosmic discoveries
- Level progression and harmonic experience points
- Share balance and Pi transaction history
- Cosmic preferences and Lattice settings

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following cosmic purposes:

### Core Lattice Functionality

- **Authentication**: Verify your Pioneer identity through Pi Network
- **Harmonic Verification**: Confirm your presence at Echo Guardian Nodes
- **Share Distribution**: Calculate and distribute Pi rewards through cosmic algorithms
- **Progress Tracking**: Maintain your cosmic journey and Lore Fragment collection
- **Echo Protection**: Prevent fraudulent activities and ensure fair harmonic resonance

### Realm Enhancement

- **Cosmic Analytics**: Understand how Pioneers interact with the Lattice (anonymized data only)
- **Echo Debugging**: Identify and resolve technical issues with Guardian encounters
- **Feature Development**: Develop new cosmic features based on Pioneer exploration patterns
- **Harmonic Optimization**: Improve app performance and Pioneer experience

### Pioneer Communication

- **Lattice Updates**: Notify you about important cosmic events and new Echo Guardians
- **Security Alerts**: Inform you about security-related matters affecting the Lattice
- **Community Events**: Share information about special cosmic events and competitions

<InfoAlert>
  We will never use your data for advertising purposes or share it with entities
  outside the cosmic Lattice.
</InfoAlert>

## Data Storage and Cosmic Security

### Harmonic Protection Measures

<FeatureCard
  icon={Shield}
  title="Lattice-Grade Security"
  description="Your data is protected using cosmic-level security measures including harmonic encryption, secure Echo servers, and regular Lattice audits."
  color="text-neon-orange"
/>

**Our cosmic security practices:**

- **Harmonic Encryption**: All data is encrypted using cosmic frequency algorithms
- **Echo Servers**: Data stored on secure, Guardian-monitored servers
- **Lattice Access Controls**: Strict access controls and Pioneer authentication
- **Regular Audits**: Periodic security assessments and cosmic updates
- **Incident Response**: Rapid response procedures for Lattice security incidents

### Data Retention in the Lattice

- **Pioneer Data**: Retained while your cosmic journey is active
- **Location Data**: Processed through harmonic algorithms, not permanently stored
- **Transaction History**: Retained for audit and cosmic compliance purposes
- **Authentication Tokens**: Automatically expire and are regularly refreshed through Lattice cycles

### Cosmic Data Location

Your data is stored in secure cosmic data centers with appropriate dimensional compliance measures. We ensure that data transfers comply with applicable privacy laws across all realms.

## Your Cosmic Privacy Rights

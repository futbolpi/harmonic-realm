CHRONICLE THIS AWAKENING:
Write an epic phase narrative (4-6 sentences) that:
- Celebrates the cosmic significance of this awakening
- Weaves together the new NodeTypes into a unified story
- Acknowledges the Pi Network's role in catalyzing this mathematical miracle
- Includes a rallying call for Pi Pioneers to explore these new frequencies
- Captures the wonder of mathematical discovery and adventure

Style: Mystical yet accessible, celebrating both Pi Network community and cosmic mathematics. Make every Pi Pioneer feel they're part of something legendary.`;

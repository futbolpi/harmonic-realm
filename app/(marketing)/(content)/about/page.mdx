# The Cosmic Lattice Awaits

We're pioneering a new realm where the **infinite digits of Pi** create a cosmic frequency grid called the Lattice. As a Pioneer (or Harmonizer), you explore your physical world to discover and resonate with geo-anchored **Nodes**—mystical points that offer mining rewards, rare lore fragments, and cosmetic treasures.

## Our Mission

To bridge the digital and physical realms through harmonic resonance. HarmonicRealm transforms your world into a living mathematical canvas, creating a sustainable and community-driven ecosystem built on the foundation of Pi.

## The Core of HarmonicRealm

The world evolves through three powerful, interconnected systems plus a rich storytelling layer.

### The Three Pillars of Exploration

      <CosmicTableCell>Harmonic Awakenings</CosmicTableCell>
      <CosmicTableCell>
        **Main Progression:** Cosmic events triggered by collective resonance.
        Each Awakening halves yields, spawns rarer Node tiers, and reveals major
        lore.

    </CosmicTableRow>
    <CosmicTableRow>
      <CosmicTableCell>Lattice Calibration Events</CosmicTableCell>
      <CosmicTableCell>
        **Community-Funded:** Pioneers collectively fund rare Node spawns
        between Awakenings. 70% of new Nodes appear in contributor-chosen areas.
      </CosmicTableCell>
    </CosmicTableRow>
    <CosmicTableRow>
      <CosmicTableCell>Resonant Anchoring</CosmicTableCell>
      <CosmicTableCell>
        **Individual Agency:** Stake Pi to anchor a permanent sponsored Node at
        any location you choose. Loyal Pioneers earn Resonance Fidelity
        discounts that grow exponentially more powerful (and costly) the more
        you use them.

## How We're Different

<InfoAlert>
  HarmonicRealm is the first geolocation adventure built on Pi’s infinite
  mathematics, where scarcity, progression, and world-shaping are entirely
  driven by community and individual action.

## The Harmonic Phases

The universe evolves through major narrative events called Harmonic Awakenings.

### Genesis Phase

- **Trigger**: 100+ Pioneers join
- **Nodes**: Common Nodes with full yield
- **Lore**: _The Lattice awakens to first resonance._

### Next Phase Awakening

- **Trigger**: Collective resonance threshold met
- **New Nodes**: 70% of new nodes spawned in region with high mining activity + yields halved
- **Lore**: _The frequency deepens; echoes multiply._

## Join the Cosmic Journey

<SuccessAlert>
  The Lattice is alive and expanding. Pioneers are already anchoring personal
  landmarks, funding global Calibrations, and unlocking legendary lore across
  the planet.
</SuccessAlert>

HarmonicRealm is more than a game—it's a living mathematical universe shaped by mathematics, community collaboration, and your footsteps.

# The Cosmic Lattice Awaits

We're pioneering a new realm where the **infinite digits of Pi** create a cosmic frequency grid called the Lattice. As a Pioneer, you explore your physical world to discover and resonate with geo-anchored **Nodes**—mystical points that offer mining rewards, rare lore fragments, and cosmetic treasures.

## Our Mission

To bridge the digital and physical realms through harmonic resonance. HarmonicRealm transforms your world into a living mathematical canvas, creating a sustainable and community-driven ecosystem built on the foundation of Pi.

## The Core of HarmonicRealm

The world evolves through three powerful, interconnected systems.

### The Three Pillars of Exploration

The game world is shaped by all Pioneers, from long-term collective progression to immediate, individual action.

        **Main Progression:** The main story spine. Reaching milestones advances
        the phase, halves yields (creating scarcity), and unlocks new Node
        tiers.

        **Community-Funded:** Pioneers collectively stake Pi to trigger events
        that spawn new rare Nodes, rewarding collaboration between main
        Awakenings.

## How We're Different

<InfoAlert>
  HarmonicRealm is the first geolocation adventure built on Pi's infinite
  mathematical foundation, where progression is driven by community
  collaboration and individual world-shaping.

## The Harmonic Phases

The universe evolves through major narrative events called Harmonic Awakenings. Each phase introduces new challenges, greater scarcity, and deeper lore.

### Genesis Phase

- **Trigger**: 100+ Pioneers join
- **New Nodes**: Genesis Nodes with the highest yield
- **Lore**: _The Lattice awakens to first resonance._

### Next Phase Awakening

- **Trigger**: Collective resonance threshold met
- **New Nodes**: 70% of new nodes spawned in region with high mining activity + yields halved
- **Lore**: _The frequency deepens; echoes multiply._

## Join the Cosmic Journey

<SuccessAlert>
  Thousands of Pioneers have already begun their journey, anchoring nodes and
  contributing to the first Lattice Calibrations.
</SuccessAlert>

HarmonicRealm is more than a game—it's a living world shaped by mathematics, community, and your own exploration.
